# Attempts at visualising panel maps

This repo contains a collection of ggplot experiments for visualising panel maps use in [`{conformr}`](https://github.com/cynthiahqy/conformr) documentation

## Experiments

This is this mapping function I tried to visualise:

```{r, echo=FALSE}
(edges <- tibble::tribble(~from, ~to, ~weighted,
                 "BLX", "BEL", 0.5,
                 "BLX", "LUX", 0.5,
                 "E.GER", "DEU", 1,
                 "W.GER", "DEU", 1,
                 "AUS", "AUS", 1)
)
```

ggplot extensions I experimented with (code in `R/` folder):

-   `{ggraph}`: way too flexible, no sensible way to keep the `from`, and `to` nodes lined up. Found some good `{tidygraph}` and `{ggraph}` resources though:
    -   <https://mr.schochastics.net/material/netVizR/>

    -   <https://dgarcia-eu.github.io/SocialDataScience/4_SNA/045_Tidygraph/tidygraph.html>
-   [`{ggsankey}`](https://github.com/davidsjoberg/ggsankey): keeps `from` and `to` nodes stacked in "stages", and connects nodes in each stage with "flow" ribbons
-   [`{ggalluvial}`](https://github.com/corybrunson/ggalluvial): terminology in documentation (lodes/alluvia/stratum..) was a bit difficult to follow (use [cheatsheets!](https://jtr13.github.io/cc21fall2/ggalluvial-cheatsheet.html)); too rigid for my purposes, and rescaling of `weighted` as flows between nodes obscures the weight information
-   [`{ggbump::geom_bump}`](https://github.com/davidsjoberg/ggbump#tutorial): removes the "flow" to line-width connection from sankey/alluvials, and adds some flexibility for node positioning, but is annoyingly restrictive requirements for `aes()` mapping -- couldn't quite map data into "rank" format
-   [`{ggbump::geom_sigmoid}`](https://github.com/davidsjoberg/ggbump#sigmoid-curves-examples): more flexible geom that probably powers `geom_bump()`, just requires calculation of starting and ending x,y coordinates for each set/stage of nodes.

Aside on errors when reproducing the map with sigmoid curves from `ggbump` readme:

-   [original code](https://github.com/davidsjoberg/tidytuesday/blob/master/2020w17/2020w17_skript.R) vs. [modified code for sf \> 1.0](R/ggbump-sigmoid-map.R)
-   need to turn off s2 spherical geometry using `sf_use_s2(FALSE)` -- see [github issue](https://github.com/r-spatial/sf/issues/1759)
-   might have been calling the wrong version of `format()` but changing `digits = 0` to `digits = 1` seemed to fix the error
